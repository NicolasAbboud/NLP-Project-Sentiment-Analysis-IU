# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews  

This project implements a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** system for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. The objective is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative** using both **classical machine learning methods** (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) and **deep learning approaches** (Neural Networks).  

---

## 📌 Project Objectives  
- Collect and preprocess movie reviews data.  
- Apply NLP preprocessing (stopword removal, lemmatization, entity filtering).  
- Train sentiment classifiers with both **classical ML** and **deep learning**.  
- Evaluate models on test data using standard metrics.  
- Deploy a prediction pipeline that can analyze new, unseen reviews.

## 📊 Dataset  

For this project, the **Stanford Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDb dataset)** was used, which is a widely used benchmark in sentiment analysis research:

## ⚙️ Preprocessing  

The preprocessing pipeline includes:  
- Removing HTML tags and punctuation  
- Lowercasing and normalizing whitespace  
- Removing stopwords (with custom stopword list)  
- Lemmatization with **spaCy**  
- Filtering out named entities of type *PERSON* to reduce noise

## 🤖 Models  

### Classical Machine Learning  
- **Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)** with TF–IDF features  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** with TF–IDF features  

### Deep Learning  
- **Feed-Forward Neural Network** (trained in `deep_learning.ipynb`)  
- Input text vectorized with TensorFlow’s `TextVectorization`  
- Architecture:  
  - Input → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dropout → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(1, Sigmoid)  

---

## 🧪 Results  

- The **neural network model** achieved the best generalization performance, outperforming Naive Bayes and SVM.  
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, confusion matrices, and validation curves (see `/results/`).

from predictor import predict_sentiment

model = load_model("./models/model_NN_final.keras")
review = "The movie is funny and heartwarming!"
predict_sentiment(model, review)
```
```text
Review preview: The movie is funny and heartwarming!...
Sentiment: Positive :) (score=0.8704)
```

## 📈 Future Work
- Integrating transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT).
- Exploring cross-domain sentiment analysis (beyond movies).
- Improving interpretability with attention or explainable AI methods.
